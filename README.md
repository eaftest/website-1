## Welcome to the GitHub Pages repo for the Espresso Aficionados website

You can find the website [here](https://espressoaf.com).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Espresso-Aficionados/website/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for this website in Markdown files. Be aware that GitHub's preview isn't always accurate to the formatting used on the website, check out existing pages to see how things are done.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

This website uses the [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) theme - you can view its documentation [here](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/).
