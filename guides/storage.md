# Coffee Storage

## Freezing coffee
Coffee can be stored in the freezer to slow down (or practically stop) the aging process of the beans.

For a quick video guide, see:
[Should You Freeze Coffee? by James Hoffmann](https://youtu.be/5uT5_IWWb00)

### General rules:
- Coffee can be safely stored in the freezer either in the original bag with valve taped over (ensure it’s a waterproof bag), freezer ziplock bags (double bagged for extra safety), mason jars, centrifuge tubes (for single dosing), or the gold standard - vacuum sealed packs.
- Avoid re-freezing the coffee if it has already been thawed once
- Freeze in 1-2week portions to maximise freshness
- Freeze when beans have sufficiently degassed and are ready to be brewed, as freezing also essentially halts degassing

### There are two ways to use beans that have been frozen
1. If you’ve frozen a larger batch and do not intend to grind all the beans immediately, allow the beans to come to room temp before exposing the beans to air. Opening the container while the beans are still cold will cause condensation to form onto the beans. Not good.
2. If you’ve frozen in single doses, you can experiment with grinding the beans immediately after removing them from the feezer - effectively grinding them “frozen”. The small amount of condensation on the beans can act like RDT and mitigate static. You'll also likely see an improvement in particle distribution range due to how beans shatter at low temps.

NOTE: Cold grounds can clump if you live in a humid environment, as moisture can condense onto the grounds while you are prepping your puck. YMMV
