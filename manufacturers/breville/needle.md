# Jake Valve Upgrade for the Breville Dual Boiler

The valve upgrade is a needle valve found by Jake_G on the home-barista forums for adding flow profiling to various espresso machines. It can be used to upgrade the stock hot water needle valve, giving a larger adjustment range than stock and is less sensitive, allowing for smoother and easier profiling.

To install the valve you need the clippard valve:

And 4mm M5 push fit connectors:

Make sure to wrap the threads with Teflon tape. As long as these have right connector sizes they should work so look around for the best prices.

To adjust the valve you can 3D print an adapter with high temperature filament to make it look stock. The stl needed are adapter body and shaft.

The entire knob can be replaced as well by printing the stls marked final.
