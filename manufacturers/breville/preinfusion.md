# Pulling Shots in Pre-Infusion Mode

## 15bar pump ruining your shots? Pull shots in pre-infusion mode only

This guide is mostly useful for **Breville Infuser** and **Barista Express** users as these machines have an in-built gauge.
It may be possible to use this technique on the **Bambino Plus** and **Breville Pro machines**, however the lack of pressure gauge may be an issue.
For base model **Bambinos**, users report that it is not possible to hold a shot in pre-infusion for more than 10 seconds, therefore this technique may not work.

If you are unable to adjust your OPV to <15bar, or do not want to open up your machine, this *pre-infusion mode only* technique can be used as an alternative when having issues maintaining puck integrity throughout the duration of the shot i.e. due to poor grind quality or when pulling light roasts.

### First test that your machine’s pre-infusion (PI) mode is capable of high enough pressures.
With your cleaning disc/blind disc in the portafilter, hold down either the 1-cup or 2-cup button to keep the pump in PI. Let pressure build until the needle stops moving (this may take around 30s). When the needle stabilises, this is the max PI pressure your machine can achieve. Let go of the button and press it once more to stop the shot.

If your machine was able to build to at least 9-10bar pressure, this technique could work for you.

### Pressure gauge readings:
The middle line of the grey-shaded “espresso zone” is 10bar. Each line is an increment of 2 bar.

### To pull in PI mode:
Press and hold the 1-cup or 2-cup button for the duration of the shot. When you reach your desired yield, quickly release and then immediately press the button again to stop the shot.

### Dialling in
Dial in your shot as you normally would, grinding fine/coarse enough to achieve enough pressure while also maintaining enough flow to reach your desired yield within 60secs.
Breville machines (with the exception of the Breville Dual Boiler) have a 60sec shot time limit.
